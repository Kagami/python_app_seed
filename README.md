Proposal
========

Every time when I start to write new python application I needed to do all this boring stuff for creating Makefile, deb packaging scripts, README, setup.py and so on. So I decided to write skeleton that I will just simple clone and focus on making stuff not the routine actions.

Idea gracefully taken as you can see from the angular-seed, Chaplin Boilerplate, Rails CLI and all that great CoC world.

This skeleton should be as simply as possible. I don't want to force you to choose some libraries over others. Just minimal application structure.

TODO
====

* README for the final app
* Tests stub
* Set `debian_revision` from the `BUILD_NUMBER` env variable

License
=======

*(Applies to the skeleton only not to the final application! This is possible because it's just Public Domain and you can use it AS you wish.)*
