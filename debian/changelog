python-app-seed (99999) unstable; urgency=low

  * Meta change. Must be first in the list. This fake version will be
    automatically replaced on `make deb' with one in the setup.py
    and for debian_revision REVISION env variable will be used.
    You still could write your important changelog stuff below or
    don't use auto versioning at all (but then your will be required
    to change version in several places at once).
